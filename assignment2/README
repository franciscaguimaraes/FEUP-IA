## About the Project
We aim to improve healthcare outcomes using the breast cancer dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adhamelkomy/breast-cancer). Our goal is to develop predictive models that reduce misdiagnosis rates, minimize unnecessary procedures, and enhance treatment outcomes for patients with breast masses.

The code was developed in Python 3.12 with Jupyter Notebook.

## Models
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest

## Run the Code

Since the project was done on Jupyter Notebook, it is necessary to have the Jupyter Notebook framework to run the code.

The following dependencies need to be installed:

```
pip install numpy pandas seaborn scikit-learn matplotlib statsmodels imbalanced-learn scipy
```
